Geo::H3 - H3 Geospatial Hexagon Indexing System

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Geo::H3;
  my $gh3      = Geo::H3->new;
  
  my $h3       = $gh3->h3(index  => $int);        #isa Geo::H3::Index
  my $h3       = $gh3->h3(string => $string);     #isa Geo::H3::Index

  my $geo      = $gh3->geo(lat=>$lat, lon=>$lon); #isa Geo::H3::Geo
  my $h3       = $geo->h3($resolution);           #isa Geo::H3::Index

  my $center   = $h3->center;                     #isa Geo::H3::GeoCoord
  my $lat      = $center->lat;                    #isa Double WGS-84 Decimal Degrees
  my $lon      = $center->lon;                    #isa Double WGS-84 Decimal Degrees
  my $distance = $center->pointDistM($geo);       #isa Double meters
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl distribution provides a Perl Object Oriented interface to the H3 Core Library.  It accesses the H3 C library using L<libffi|https://github.com/libffi/libffi> and L<FFI::Platypus>.

H3 is a geospatial indexing system that partitions the world into hexagonal cells.

The H3 Core Library implements the H3 grid system. It includes functions for converting from latitude and longitude coordinates to the containing H3 cell, finding the center of H3 cells, finding the boundary geometry of H3 cells, finding neighbors of H3 cells, and more.

The H3 Core Library can be installed from Uber's H3 repository on GitHub L<https://github.com/uber/h3> which is well documented at L<https://h3geo.org/docs/>.  

=head2 CONVENTIONS

The Geo::H3 lib is an Object Oriented wrapper on top of the L<Geo::H3::FFI> library.  Geo::H3 was written as a wrapper so that in the future we are able to re-write against different backends such as the yet to be developed Geo::H3::XS backend.

=head3 libh3

  - Latitude and longitue cordinates are in radians WGS-84
  - H3 Index values are handled as uint64 integers
  - GeoCoord values are handled as C structures with lat and lon
  - GeoBoundary values are handled as C structures with num_verts and verts

=head3 Geo::H3::FFI

  - Latitude and Longitue cordinates are in radians WGS-84
  - H3 Index values are handled as uint64 integers
  - GeoCoord values are handled as Geo::H3::FFI::Struct::GeoCoord objects
  - GeoBoundary values are handled as Geo::H3::FFI::Struct::GeoBoundary objects

=head3 Geo::H3

  - Latitude and longitue cordinates are in decimal degrees WGS-84
  - H3 Index values are handled as Geo::H3::Index objects
  - GeoCoord values are handled as Geo::H3::GeoCoord objects
  - GeoBoundary values are handled as Geo::H3::GeoBoundary objects

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 h3

Returns a L<Geo::H3::Index> object

  my $h3 = $gh3->h3(index  => $int);             #isa Geo::H3::Index
  my $h3 = $gh3->h3(string => $string);          #isa Geo::H3::Index
  my $h3 = Geo::H3::Index->new(index => $index); #isa Geo::H3::Index

=cut

sub h3 {
  my $self   = shift;
  my %data   = @_;
  my $index  = $data{'index'};
  my $string = $data{'string'};
  if ($index) {
    return Geo::H3::Index->new(index => $index, ffi => $self->ffi);
  } elsif ($string) {
    my $index = $self->ffi->stringToH3Wrapper($string) or die("Error: package $PACKAGE constructor h3 string invalid");
    return Geo::H3::Index->new(index => $index, ffi => $self->ffi);
  } else {
    die("Error: package $PACKAGE constructor h3 requires either index or string");
  }
}

=head2 geo

Returns a L<Geo::H3::Geo> object

  my $geo = $gh3->geo(lat=>$lat_deg, lon=>$lon_deg);         #isa Geo::H3::Geo
  my $geo = Geo::H3::Geo->new(lat=>$lat_deg, lon=>$lon_deg); #isa Geo::H3::Geo

=cut

sub geo {
  my $self     = shift;
  my %data     = @_;
  $data{'ffi'} = $self->ffi unless exists $data{'ffi'};
  return Geo::H3::Geo->new(%data);
};

=head1 INSTALLATION

L<Geo::H3> has some pretty deep requirements that are not available in many OS repositories.  For RedHat and CentOS 7 users, I have have built RPMs and placed them on my L<Linux Yum Repository|http://linux.davisnetworks.com/el7/>

To install the distribution with all dependencies - CentOS 7

  $ sudo yum install http://linux.davisnetworks.com/el7/updates/mrdvt92-release-8-2.el7.mrdvt92.noarch.rpm
  $ sudo yum install 'perl(Geo::H3)'

To install the additional dependencies for the example script perl-Geo-H3-geo-to-googleearth.pl

  $ sudo yum install 'perl(Geo::GoogleEarth::Pluggable)' 'perl(Geo::GoogleEarth::Pluggable::Plugin::Styles)' 'perl(Path::Class)'
